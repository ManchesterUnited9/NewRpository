Are there any outliers?           No

Is the distribution normal, symmetric, skewed, or some other shape?          No

b) Categorical variables, include a frequency and relative frequency table.

c) Include a two-way table for two of the categorical variables and discuss any relevant proportions. Describe any possible relationship between the two variables. 

Answer:

•	There is an association between absolute frequency table and relative frequency table. These are called bivariate associations.

•	Summarize the linear relationship.

•	We can calculate the correlation.

•	It is used more widely, more sensitive to errors and discrepancies in data.

3. Preform hypothesis test

(a) Using the appropriate statistical test, preform a hypothesis test comparing a mean to a fixed value. Make certain to properly state your null and alternative hypothesis. State your conclusion in the correct statistical language.

Answer:

Null and alternative hypothesis are two mutually exclusive statements about a goal count and display the mean value.

Null hypothesis (H0): Parameter (such as the mean, standard deviation, and so on) is equal to a hypothesized value, according to the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis is an argument that is often made based on prior analyses or advanced expertise.

H0: μ = m0

Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The alternative hypothesis states is smaller parameter, more, or different from the null hypothesis. The alternate hypothesis is what we expect or wish to prove to be right.

H1: μ = m1

Conclusion:

H0: μ = m0 and H1: μ = m1 are the hypotheses for this test and the P-value is the significance amount 2.818533.

(b) Using the appropriate statistical test, preform a hypothesis test comparing two means. Make certain to properly state your null and alternative hypothesis. State your conclusion in the correct statistical language.

Null hypothesis is H0, it has “no effect” and “no difference”.

H0: μ1 – μ2 = 0, which is same as H0: μ1 = μ2

Alternative hypothesis.

H1: μ1 – μ2 < 0, which is same as H1: μ1 < μ2

H1: μ1 – μ2 > 0, which is same as H1: μ1 > μ2

H1: μ1 – μ2 ≠ 0, which is same as H1: μ1 ≠ μ2

Conclusion:

H0: μ1 – μ2 = 0 and H1: μ1 – μ2 > 0 are the hypotheses for this test. We reject H0 and accept H1 since the P-value is smaller significance amount 1.293436.

(a) Introduce your data set including a reference to where it can be found. Describe all relevant variables that you will use in your analysis.

Answer:

I have downloaded the england-premier-league-matches-2018-to-2019-stats.csv file using the link “https://footystats.org/download-stats-csv” and sorted data by four rows (date, goal_count, goals_at_half_time and stadium.
 
In this file date column denotes the date of the match, goal_count column denotes the number of goal, goals_at_half_time column denotes the goal before half time and stadium column denotes where the match played.

(b) Include all items requested above. Include graphs and text about each.

	Answer: All statistics data, graph and relationship I have explained above in details.

(c) Write a brief conclusion highlighting the most interesting features of your data.

Answer: 

This file contains the stadium and the number of goals stats. It contains more in-depth data. From the statistical analysis I can conclude the history of the stadium and the highest goal in which stadium. Most interesting part is from the data stats I can choose top 5 stadium for future league purpose and the importance of the stadium.
